Hey y’all, I’m Arun Haridas!
I’m a Full Stack Developer with over 9 years of experience building scalable, secure, and user-friendly web applications. I’m currently based in the UK, working with Cognizant on Public sector projects. My journey started in India, where I earned my degree in Computer Applications and trained in .NET technologies at NIIT.

Over the years, I’ve worked across India, Saudi Arabia, and the UK, contributing to projects in sectors like education, insurance, ERP, and government services. I specialize in Microsoft technologies like ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, and Azure PaaS, and I’m equally comfortable with modern JavaScript frameworks like Angular (2–16), Hapi.js, and TypeScript.

Whether it’s designing reusable UI components, implementing secure authentication systems, or automating deployments with Azure DevOps and Jenkins, I love solving complex problems and delivering clean, maintainable code. When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring new tech trends and refining my skills in cloud architecture and DevOps.
